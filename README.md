# Marvel Snap Comic Website Project

## Introduction

This project aims to create a website that functions as a Marvel Snap card and comic database, similar to www.snap.fan or marvelsnapzone.com. It will primarily be a database that displays the variants of each card side by side with their corresponding comic cover art (when applicable). Additionally, the comic information will include links to read the comic on Marvel Unlimited and Amazon, as well as relevant information from Marvel.com.

The database will be searchable and filterable based on various criteria, including:

-   Power
-   Energy
-   Series
-   Artist
-   Card Name
-   Variant Name

## Hour 1: VS Code Installation and Project Setup

In this hour, I installed VS Code, created a new project folder, and set up the initial project files.

### Installation

I downloaded and installed VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](code.visualstudio.com). I also installed the Python extension.

### Project Setup

I created a project folder named "marvel-snap-comic-website" and added the following files:

-   `index.html`: For the basic HTML structure of the website.
-   `app.py`: For the Flask application.
-   `.gitignore`: For files that git should ignore.
